## Intro

- I successfully completed Workshop 0 and was inspired to create another animation using similar techniques for the workshop 1. For my next project, I decided to develop a butterfly animation, focusing primarily on changing its colors dynamically. I referred to the p5.js tutorial on variables and change (https://p5js.org/tutorials/variables-and-change/) and explored various online resources for creating butterfly animations. There were numerous exemplars and projects related to butterfly animations, many of which were highly engaging and provided valuable inspiration.
